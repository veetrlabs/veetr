### Field Behavior

**Always Present:**
- `SOG`, `COG`, `lat`, `lon`, `sat`, `hdop` - GPS data (0 values if no GPS fix)
- `rssi` - BLE signal strength

**Conditionally Present:**
- `AWS` - Only present if wind sensor is connected and working
- `AWA` - Only present if wind sensor is connected and working
- `TWS` - Only present if wind sensor and GPS are working (calculated from AWS, AWA, SOG)
- `TWA` - Only present if wind sensor and GPS are working (calculated from AWA, SOG)  
- `hl` - Only present if BNO080 IMU sensor is detected and working
- `HDM` - Only present if BNO080 magnetometer is working and has valid data
- `accelX`, `accelY`, `accelZ` - Only present if BNO080 accelerometer is working and has valid data
- `ln` - Only present if regatta start line is configured AND GPS has valid fix

### BLE MTU and Payload Optimization

The system negotiates a larger MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) with the client to accommodate comprehensive telemetry data:

**MTU Configuration:**
- **Negotiated MTU:** 185 bytes (from default 23 bytes)
- **Payload Limit:** 180 bytes (conservative safety margin)
- **Field Optimization:** Shortened field names and integer values to minimize JSON size

**Graceful Payload Reduction:**
If a telemetry message exceeds 180 bytes, the firmware automatically removes optional fields in this order:
1. Acceleration data (`accelX`, `accelY`, `accelZ`)
2. Pitch angle (`pitch`)
3. RSSI signal strength (`rssi`)
4. HDOP precision (`hdop`)

This ensures critical sailing data (speed, wind, position, heel, heading) is always transmitted even with MTU constraints.

### GPS Speed Filtering

The system includes intelligent GPS speed filtering that combines GPS track analysis with accelerometer data to accurately distinguish real vessel movement from GPS noise when stationary or docked.

**How it works:**
1. **GPS Track Analysis:** Collects recent GPS positions and analyzes the vessel's track for distance traveled and bearing changes
2. **Accelerometer Movement Detection:** Analyzes acceleration magnitude variations to detect physical movement independent of GPS
3. **Sensor Fusion:** Combines both GPS and accelerometer data for more accurate movement detection
4. **Quality Check:** Only uses GPS data with ≥4 satellites and HDOP ≤ 3.0
5. **Adaptive Thresholds:** Adjusts noise filtering thresholds based on sensor confidence
6. **Hysteresis:** Different thresholds prevent speed "flickering" between 0 and low values

**Key Features:**
- **Dual-Sensor Validation:** Uses both GPS track analysis and accelerometer data when IMU is available
- **Independent Movement Detection:** Accelerometer provides movement confirmation independent of GPS signal quality
- **Adaptive Filtering:** Lower thresholds when both sensors confirm movement, higher when stationary
- **Graceful Degradation:** Falls back to GPS-only filtering when IMU sensor is not available
- **Responsive:** Quickly detects when vessel starts moving after being stationary

**Enhanced Thresholds (with Accelerometer):**
- **High Confidence Movement:** 0.05 knots (both GPS and accelerometer detect movement)
- **Normal Filtering:** 0.08 knots (mixed signals or IMU unavailable)
- **High Confidence Stationary:** 0.12 knots (both sensors confirm stationary state)
- **Start Moving Hysteresis:** +0.1 knots above respective threshold

**Accelerometer Movement Detection:**
- **Acceleration Variance:** Detects changes in acceleration magnitude indicating movement
- **Magnitude Analysis:** Monitors total acceleration range and standard deviation
- **Validation:** Ensures accelerometer readings are reasonable (gravity present: 8-12 m/s²)
- **Noise Immunity:** Filters false positives from sensor noise or vibrations

**Why This Approach:**
This dual-sensor approach significantly improves accuracy over GPS-only filtering:
- **Eliminates False Positives:** GPS noise won't register as movement without accelerometer confirmation
- **Reduces False Negatives:** Real movement detected by accelerometer even with poor GPS signal
- **Better Sensitivity:** Can detect very slow movement (below GPS noise floor) when accelerometer confirms motion
- **Marine Environment Optimized:** Accounts for wave motion, anchoring, and low-speed maneuvering scenarios

### Error Handling

The system is designed to be robust against sensor failures:

- **Missing GPS:** System continues to operate, GPS fields show default values
- **Missing Wind Sensor:** Wind fields (`AWS`, `AWA`, `TWS`, `TWA`) are omitted from JSON
- **Missing IMU Sensor:** Heel field is omitted from JSON
- **Sensor Failures:** Individual sensor failures don't affect other sensors or BLE transmission
- **BLE Reliability:** JSON is transmitted every 1 second regardless of sensor status

### BLE Commands

The Veetr Sailing Dashboard supports bidirectional communication via a dedicated command characteristic. This allows web applications to configure device settings and trigger actions remotely.

#### Command Characteristic

- **Characteristic UUID:** `11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555`
- **Properties:** Write
- **Data Format:** JSON string encoded as UTF-8

#### Available Commands

**1. Reset Heel Angle (Calibration)**
```json
{
  "action": "resetHeelAngle"
}
```
Calibrates the heel angle sensor by setting the current tilt as the new zero point. Useful for adjusting when the boat is level.

**2. Get Device Name**
```json
{
  "cmd": "GET_DEVICE_NAME"
}
```
Requests the current BLE device name. The device responds with:
```json
{
  "type": "device_name",
  "deviceName": "Veetr"
}
```
Device name is fetched on-demand rather than included in every telemetry message to save bandwidth.

**3. Set Device Name**
```json
{
  "action": "setDeviceName",
  "deviceName": "Luna_Port_Side"
}
```
Sets the BLE device name used for Bluetooth discovery. This is essential for distinguishing between multiple ESP32 devices. Limited to 1-20 characters, alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen, and space only.

**4. Regatta Line Configuration**
```json
{
  "action": "regattaSetPort"
}
```
```json
{
  "action": "regattaSetStarboard"
}
```
Sets the port and starboard ends of the regatta start line at current GPS position. The device calculates distance to line and includes `ln` field in telemetry (negative = behind line, positive = crossed).

**5. Get Regatta Line Coordinates**
```json
{
  "cmd": "GET_REGATTA_LINE"
}
```
Requests stored regatta line coordinates. The device responds with:
```json
{
  "type": "regatta_coords",
  "portLat": 37.7749,
  "portLon": -122.4194,
  "starboardLat": 37.7750,
  "starboardLon": -122.4195
}
```

#### Multi-Device Management

The device name feature is particularly useful for sailing applications with multiple sensors:

- **Fleet Management:** "Veetr_01", "Veetr_02", "Veetr_03"
- **Multi-Hull Boats:** "Veetr_Port", "Veetr_Starboard"
- **Multiple Locations:** "Veetr_Mast", "Veetr_Cockpit"
- **Development/Testing:** "Veetr_Dev", "Veetr_Prod"

When you change the device name, the ESP32 immediately restarts its BLE advertising with the new name, making it instantly discoverable under the new identifier.

### Example Client Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
// Connect to Veetr Sailing BLE device
const device = await navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
  filters: [{ name: 'Veetr_Sailing' }],

## Hardware Components

- ESP32 DevKitC WROOM-32U (main controller with external antenna)
- NEO-7M GPS Module with external antenna
- Ultrasonic Wind Speed and Direction Sensor (RS485) - **Auto-detects sensor format**
- GY-BNO080 9-Axis IMU Sensor (I2C)
- RS485 to UART Converter Module

### Wind Sensor Compatibility

The system automatically detects and supports two different ultrasonic wind sensor formats:

- **IEEE754 Format**: 9600 baud, 8E1, registers 0x0001, IEEE 754 float encoding
- **Integer Format**: 4800 baud, 8N1, registers 0x0000, integer×100 encoding

Auto-detection occurs at startup by attempting communication with each format and validating the response data. Once detected, the system locks to the working format for optimal performance.

- **Connected but no data appears**
  - Check the BLE connection status indicator in the dashboard
  - Refresh the page and try reconnecting
  - If using real sensors, verify they are properly connected to the ESP32
  - Check the ESP32 serial monitor output for any error messages
  - Try restarting the ESP32

- **iOS/Safari compatibility issues**
  - Unfortunately, iOS Safari does not support Web Bluetooth API
  - Use an Android device or desktop browser instead
  - Consider using a third-party iOS browser that might support Web Bluetooth (limited options)

- **Data updates are slow or intermittent**
  - This may be due to BLE connection quality or interference
  - Move closer to the ESP32
  - Remove sources of 2.4GHz interference (WiFi, microwaves, etc.)
  - Try restarting both the ESP32 and reconnecting from the browser

#### Sensor-Specific Troubleshooting

- **GPS shows no satellites or zero speed**
  - Ensure GPS antenna has clear view of sky
  - Move away from buildings, trees, or other obstructions
  - GPS requires 30-90 seconds for initial satellite acquisition
  - Check that GPS module is properly connected to pins 16/17

- **Wind data not appearing in JSON**
  - Verify wind sensor is connected to RS485 converter
  - Check RS485 converter connections to ESP32 pins 32/33
  - Ensure wind sensor has proper power supply (5-12V, 5V power bank works)
  - Check serial console for auto-detection messages during startup
  - System automatically tries both IEEE754 and integer formats
  - Wind sensor data only appears in JSON when sensor is detected and working
  - If auto-detection fails, verify Modbus address is set to 1 on the sensor

- **Heel angle not appearing in JSON**
  - Verify BNO080 IMU sensor is connected to I2C pins 21/22
  - Check that IMU sensor has proper power supply (3.3V)
  - Heel data only appears in JSON when IMU sensor is detected at startup
  - If IMU sensor fails after startup, heel data will stop appearing

- **JSON missing expected fields**
  - This is normal behavior - fields are omitted if sensors are not available
  - Only GPS fields (SOG, COG, lat, lon, satellites, hdop) and RSSI are always present
  - Wind fields (AWS, AWD) only appear when wind sensor is connected
  - Heel field only appears when IMU sensor is detected and working

## Development

### Sensor Calibration and Configuration

#### GPS Module (NEO-7M)

1. **Initial Setup**
   - The GPS module requires a clear view of the sky to acquire a satellite fix
   - For best results, position the antenna horizontally with an unobstructed view
   - Initial satellite acquisition can take 30-90 seconds in ideal conditions, or longer in poor conditions
   - The blue LED on the GPS module will blink when it has a fix

2. **Configuration Options**
   - The GPS update rate is set to 1Hz by default (in `src/sensors/gps.cpp`)
   - To modify GPS settings, you can adjust the following parameters:
     ```cpp
     // Change update rate (default is 1Hz)
     const int GPS_UPDATE_RATE = 1000; // in milliseconds
     
     // Change serial baud rate if needed
     const int GPS_BAUD_RATE = 9600;
     ```

#### IMU Sensor (BNO080)

1. **Calibration Process**
   - The BNO080 IMU sensor has built-in calibration algorithms that continuously calibrate the sensor
   - For manual calibration reset:
     1. Position the ESP32 and IMU sensor in a perfectly level position
     2. Navigate to the dashboard's Settings tab
     3. Click "Calibrate IMU Sensor"
     4. Wait for the calibration to complete (about 5 seconds)
     5. The calibration values are stored in the ESP32's flash memory

2. **Sensor Fusion Features**
   - The BNO080 provides automatic sensor fusion combining accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data
   - Built-in drift compensation and noise filtering
   - Quaternion output for precise orientation tracking
   - No manual calibration typically required for basic tilt measurements

3. **Mounting Considerations**
   - Mount the IMU sensor with the X-axis aligned with the fore-aft axis of the boat
   - The Y-axis should be aligned with the port-starboard axis
   - The Z-axis should be pointing upward
   - The BNO080's sensor fusion algorithms can compensate for minor mounting misalignments
   - For best results, mount rigidly to minimize vibration effects

#### Wind Sensor

1. **Auto-Detection**
   - The system automatically detects your wind sensor format at startup
   - Supports both IEEE754 float (9600,8E1) and integer (4800,8N1) formats
   - No manual configuration required - the system tests both formats and locks to the working one
   - Detection status is shown in the serial console during startup

2. **Supported Formats**
   - **IEEE754 Format**: 9600 baud, 8E1, registers 0x0001, speed as IEEE 754 float
   - **Integer Format**: 4800 baud, 8N1, registers 0x0000, speed as integer×100

3. **Calibration**
   - The ultrasonic wind sensor should be calibrated according to manufacturer instructions
   - Most sensors require physical calibration at installation (aligning to boat's centerline)
   - No software calibration is typically needed as readings are absolute
     const int WIND_UPDATE_RATE = 1000;    // Update rate in milliseconds
     const int WIND_SENSOR_BAUDRATE = 9600; // Baud rate for RS485 communication
     ```

3. **Mounting Position**
   - Mount the wind sensor at the highest practical point for accurate readings
   - Ensure it's away from obstructions that could cause wind shadow or turbulence
   - For powerboats or when running with engines, be aware that exhaust gases can affect readings
